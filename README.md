--- Overview 
I have created a simple calendar that allows users to save event for each hour of the day. I have also added a "Add to Calendar" for users to not only organize their schedule, but make appointments as well. 

Challenge
A company has given me a objective to demonstrate my skills by creating a workday schedule. 

User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

Aceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

My Process/### What I learned
I have watched many YouTube videos, searched on W3 schools website and re-watched my class lectures to help me implement my coding to provide a proper calendar scheduler. 
A book I have purchased, "Javascript & Jquery" by Jon Duckett, really helped me implement live time on the calendar and really structure the application properly.
